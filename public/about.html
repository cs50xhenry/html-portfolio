<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I created this website as a personal goal to become a Full Stack Web Developer. I am dedicating at least 1-2 hours per day to accomplish this goal. I am a father of 3 children and I enjoy cooking and spending time with family. </p>

<p>My background in web development is beginner level. The first course I've taken was an Web Design for Beginners class in high school. I've always been fascinated by html and coding however I was always too embarassed of my abilities to learn. I was never a great student and my grades were always mediocre.</p>

<p>I'm now 34 and still learning how to learn and hopefully Angela's Udemy course will make it easier for me. Wish me luck!</p>
